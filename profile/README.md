## What is Macrium Reflect?

**Macrium Reflect** is a highly trusted and award-winning disk imaging and backup solution for Microsoft Windows. It provides both individuals and businesses with powerful tools to create complete images of their disks, partitions, or individual files and folders. The core strength of Reflect lies in its ability to perform reliable **disk cloning**, allowing you to migrate your entire system, including the operating system, applications, and all data, to a new hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD) without reinstalling anything.

Beyond cloning, Macrium Reflect excels as a comprehensive backup utility, enabling you to schedule automatic backups, perform incremental and differential images to save space, and restore your system to a previous state in minutes in the event of data corruption, malware infection, or hardware failure. Its **disaster recovery** features are robust, including the ability to create a bootable rescue media (USB or CD/DVD) to restore your computer even if Windows cannot start.

With an intuitive interface, strong performance, and a proven track record, Macrium Reflect is an essential tool for data protection, system migration, and peace of mind.
